# Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning

This repository contains my solutions to the lab sessions of the course *Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning*, taught by Professor [Edie Miglio](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NASdpJkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Matteo Caldana](https://github.com/MatteoCaldana) during the Academic Year 2024â€“2025.  
You will also find some notes written in $\LaTeX$ on selected topics. The compiled PDF is available in the **Releases** section of the repository.

## Installation

I recommend setting up a virtual environment using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Once created, you can install the required dependencies to complete the assignments by running:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
